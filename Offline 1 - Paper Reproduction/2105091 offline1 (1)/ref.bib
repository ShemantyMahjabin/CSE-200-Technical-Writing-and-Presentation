abstract = {Consider the following Online Boolean Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem: We are given an n x n matrix M and will receive n column-vectors of size n, denoted by v1, ..., vn, one by one. After seeing each vector vi, we have to output the product Mvi before we can see the next vector. A naive algorithm can solve this problem using O(n3) time in total, and its running time can be slightly improved to O(n3/log2 n) [Williams SODA'07]. We show that a conjecture that there is no truly subcubic (O(n3-ε)) time algorithm for this problem can be used to exhibit the underlying polynomial time hardness shared by many dynamic problems. For a number of problems, such as subgraph connectivity, Pagh's problem, d-failure connectivity, decremental single-source shortest paths, and decremental transitive closure, this conjecture implies tight hardness results. Thus, proving or disproving this conjecture will be very interesting as it will either imply several tight unconditional lower bounds or break through a common barrier that blocks progress with these problems. This conjecture might also be considered as strong evidence against any further improvement for these problems since refuting it will imply a major breakthrough for combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication and other long-standing problems if the term "combinatorial algorithms" is interpreted as "Strassen-like algorithms" [Ballard et al. SPAA'11].The conjecture also leads to hardness results for problems that were previously based on diverse problems and conjectures -- such as 3SUM, combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication, triangle detection, and multiphase -- thus providing a uniform way to prove polynomial hardness results for dynamic algorithms; some of the new proofs are also simpler or even become trivial. The conjecture also leads to stronger and new, non-trivial, hardness results, e.g., for the fully-dynamic densest subgraph and diameter problems.},

abstract = {We consider a number of dynamic problems with no known poly-logarithmic upper bounds, and show that they require nΩ(1) time per operation, unless 3SUM has strongly subquadratic algorithms. Our result is modular: (1) We describe a carefully-chosen dynamic version of set disjointness (the "multiphase problem"), and conjecture that it requires n^Omega(1) time per operation. All our lower bounds follow by easy reduction. (2) We reduce 3SUM to the multiphase problem. Ours is the first nonalgebraic reduction from 3SUM, and allows 3SUM-hardness results for combinatorial problems. For instance, it implies hardness of reporting all triangles in a graph. (3) It is plausible that an unconditional lower bound for the multiphase problem can be established via a number-on-forehead communication game.},

    abstract = { Abstract The 3SUM conjecture has proven to be a valuable tool for proving conditional lower bounds on dynamic data structures and graph problems. This line of work was initiated by Pâtraşcu (STOC 2010) who reduced 3SUM to an offline SetDisjointness problem. However, the reduction introduced by Pâtraşcu suffers from several inefficiencies, making it difficult to obtain tight conditional lower bounds from the 3SUM conjecture. In this paper we address many of the deficiencies of Pâtraşcu's framework. We give new and efficient reductions from 3SUM to offline SetDisjointness and offline SetIntersection (the reporting version of SetDisjointness) which leads to polynomially higher lower bounds on several problems. Using our reductions, we are able to show the essential optimality of several algorithms, assuming the 3SUM conjecture. Chiba and Nishizeki's O(mα)-time algorithm (SICOMP 1985) for enumerating all triangles in a graph with arboricity/degeneracy α is essentially optimal, for any α. Bjørklund, Pagh, Williams, and Zwick's algorithm (ICALP 2014) for listing t triangles is essentially optimal (assuming the matrix multiplication exponent is ω = 2). Any static data structure for SetDisjointness that answers queries in constant time must spend Ω(N2–o(1)) time in preprocessing, where N is the size of the set system. These statements were unattainable via Pâtraşcu's reductions. We also introduce several new reductions from 3SUM to pattern matching problems and dynamic graph problems. Of particular interest are new conditional lower bounds for dynamic versions of Maximum Cardinality Matching, which introduce a new technique for obtaining amortized lower bounds. }
